# django-drf
### This is a on-going project using Django Rest Framework. In this project, my goal is to leverage tools such as Docker, Celery, Redis, Flower, Nginx, Nginx Proxy manager, Portainer and use shell scripts. The project is setup in a dev Environment and later be deployed to cloud as fully functional that can be used in Production.
